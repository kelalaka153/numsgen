# Backdoors up my sleeve 

SHA-1 was designed by NSA and uses the constants `5a827999`,
`6ed9eba1`, `8f1bbcdc`, and `ca62c1d6`. In case you haven't
already noticed, these are hex representations of $2^{30}$ times the
square roots of 2, 3, 5 and 10.

NIST's P-256 elliptic curve was also designed by NSA and uses
coefficients derived from a hash of the seed `c49d3608 86e70493
6a6678e1 139d26b7 819f7e90`. Don't look for decimals of square roots
here; we've no idea where this value comes from.

Which algorithm would you trust the most? Right, SHA-1. We don't know
why 2, 3, 5, 10 rather than 2, 3, 5, 7, or why the square root rather than
the logarithm, but this looks more convincing than some unexplained
random-looking number.

Plausible constants such as $\sqrt 2$ are often called
"nothing-up-my-sleeve" (NUMS) constants, meaning that there's a
kinda-convincing explanation of their origin. But it isn't impossible to
backdoor an algorithm with only NUMS constants, it's just more
difficult. 

There's basically two ways to create a NUMS-looking backdoored algorithm:

1. Bruteforce NUMS constants til one matches the backdoor conditions

2. Bruteforce backdoor constants til one looks NUMS

The first approach sounds easier, because bruteforcing backdoor
constants is unlikely to yield a NUMS constant, and anyway, how do you
check that some constant in NUMS? Precompute a huge table and look up?
In that case, you're better off bruteforcing NUMS constants directly
(and you may not need to store them). In any case, you'll need *many
NUMS constants*.

I've been thinking about this a lot after my research on malicious hash
functions. So I set out to write a simple program that would generate a
huge corpus of NUMSish constants, to demonstrate to
non-cryptographers---well aware of the fact---that
"nothing-up-my-sleeve" doesn't give much guarantee, as pointed out by
Thomas Pornin on
<http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/16364/why-do-nothing-up-my-sleeve-numbers-have-low-entropy/16366#16366>.

The Python program at <https://github.com/veorq/numsgen> generates
almost 2 million constants, while I'm writing this.
Nothing new nor clever here: it's just about exploiting degrees of
freedom in the process of going from a plausible seed to actual
constants. In that PoC program, I went for the following method:

1. Pick a plausible seed 
2. Encode it to a byte string
3. Hash it using some hash function
4. Decode the hash result to the actual constants

Each step gives you freedom degrees and the game is to find kinda
plausible choices.

As I discovered after releasing this, DJB and others did a similar
exercise in the context of manipulated elliptic curves in their "BADA55
curves" paper (<http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/bada55.html>), though I don't
think they released their code. Anyway, they make the same point:
"The BADA55-VPR curves illustrate the fact that 'verifiably
pseudorandom' curves with 'systematic' seeds generated from
'nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers'  also do not stop the attacker from
generating a curve with a one-in-a-million weakness."
The two works obviously overlap, but we use slightly different tricks.


## Seeds

We want to start from some special number, or more precisely that will
*look* special. We cited SHA-1's use of $\sqrt 2$, $\sqrt 3$, $\sqrt 5$,
$\sqrt 10$, but we could have cited

* $\pi$ used in ARIA, BLAKE, Blowfish
* MD5 using "the integer part of 4294967296 times abs(sin(i))"
* SHA-1 using `0123456789abcdeffedcba9876543210f0e1d2c3` as initial value
* SHA-2 using square roots and cube roots of the first primes
* NewDES using the US Declaration of Independence
* Brainpool curves using SHA-1 hashes of $\pi$ and $e$


Special numbers may thus be universal math constants such as $\pi$ or
$e$, or some random-looking sequence derived from a special number:
small integers such as 2, 3, 5, or some number related to the design
(like the closest prime number to the security level), or the designer's
birthday, or his daughter's birthday, etc.

For most numbers, functions like square root or trigonometric functions
yield an *irrational* number, namely one that can't be expressed as a
fraction, and with infinite random-looking decimal expansion.
This means that we've an infinite number of digits to choose from!

Let's now enumerate some NUMS numbers. Obviously what will look
plausible to the average user may not for the experienced cryptographer,
so the notion of "plausibility" is subjective. Below we'll restrict
ourselves to constants similar to those used in previous designs, but
many more could be imagined (like physical universal constants, text
rather than numbers, etc. etc.). Actually we'll even restrict ourselves
to *irrational* numbers: $\pi$, $e$, $\varphi=(1+\sqrt 5)/2$ (golden
ratio), Euler-Mascheroni's $\gamma$, ApÃ©ry's $\zeta(3)$ constant, and
irrationals produced from integers by the following functions

* Natural logarithm, $\ln(x)$, irrational for any rational $x>1$

* Decimal logarithm, $\log(x)$, irrational unless $x=10^n$ for some
  integer $n$

* Square root, $\sqrt x$, irrational unless $x$ is a perfect square

* Cubic root, $\sqrt[3]x$, irrational unless $x$ is a perfect cube

* Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, and tangent, irrational for all
  non-zero integers

We'll feed these functions with the first six primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. 
This guarantees that all functions will return irrationals. 

Now that we've a bunch of irrationals, what digits do we record? Since
there's an infinite number of them, we've to choose. Again, this
*precision* must be some plausible number. 
That's why this PoC takes the first $N$ *significant digits*---rather
than just the fractional part---for the following values of $N$: 42, 50,
100, 200, 500, 1000, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024. 

We thus have 6 primes combined with 7 functions mapping them to
irrationals, plus 6 irrationals, for a total of 48 numbers. Multiplying
by 12 different precisions. That's 576 irrationals. For each of those,
we also take the multiplicative inverse. For the one of the two that's
greater than one, we also take the fractional part (thus stripping the
leading digit from the significant digits). We thus have in total
$3\times 576=1728$ seeds.

Note that seeds needn't be numerical values. They can be anything that
can be hashed, which means pretty much anything: text, images, etc.
However, it may be more difficult to explain why your seed is a Word
document or a PCAP than if it's just raw numbers or text.


## Encodings

Cryptographers aren't known for being good programmers, so we can
plausibly deny an awkward encoding of the seeds. The PoC tries the
obvious raw bytes encoding, but also ASCII of the decimal, hex (lower and
upper case), or even binary digits (with and without the `0b` prefix).
It also tries base64 of raw bytes, or of the decimal integer. 

To get more freedom degrees you could use more exotic encodings, add
termination characters, timestamps, and so on, but the simpler the
better.


## Hashes

The purpose of hashing to generate constants is at least threefold

1. Ensure that the constant looks *uniformly* random, that it has no
symmetries or structure. This is for example important for hash
functions' initial values. Hash functions can thus "sanitize" similar
NUMS by produce completely different constants:  
```
>>> hex(int(math.tanh(5)*10**16))
'0x23861f0946f3a0'
>>> sha1(_).hexdigest()
'b96cf4dcd99ae8aec4e6d0443c46fe0651a44440'
>>> hex(int(math.tanh(7)*10**16))
'0x2386ee907ec8d6'
>>> sha1(_).hexdigest()
'7c25092e3fed592eb55cf26b5efc7d7994786d69'
```

2. Reduce the length of the number to the size of the constant. If your
seed is the first 1000 digits of $\pi$, how do you generate 128-bit
value that depends on all the digits?

3. Give the impression of "cryptographic strength". Some people
associate the use of cryptography with security and confidence, and may
believe that constants generated with SHA-3 are safer than constants
generated with SHA-1.

Obviously we want a cryptographic hash rather than some fast-and-weak
hash like CRCs. A natural choice is to start with MD5, SHA-1, and the
four SHA-2 versions. You may also want to use SHA-3 or BLAKE2, which
will give you even more freedom degrees in choosing their
version/parameters.

Rather than just a hash, you can use a *keyed hash*. In my PoC program,
I used HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA1, both with $3\times 3$ combinations of key
length and value.

Another option, with even more freedom degrees, is a *key
derivation*---or password hashing---function.  My PoC applies
PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1, the most common instance of PBKDF2, with: either 32,
64, 128, 512, 1024, 10, 100, or 1000 iterations; a salt of 8, 16, or 32
bytes, either all-zero or all-ones. That's 48 versions.

The PoC thus tries $6+18+48=72$ different hash functions.


## Decodings

Decoding of the hash to actual constant depends on what constants you
want. In this PoC I just want four 32-bit constants, so I only take the
first 128 bits from the hash and parse them either as big- of
little-endian.


## Conclusion

That's all pretty simple, and you could argue that some choices aren't
that plausible (binary encoding??). But that kind of thing would be
enough to fool many, and most would probably give you the benefit of the
doubt. After all, only some pesky cryptographers object to NIST's
unexplained curves.

So with 1728 seeds, 8 encodings, 72 hash function instances, and 2
decodings, we have a total of $1728 \times 8 \times 72 \times 2 =
1,990,656$ candidate constants.
If your constants are more sophisticated objects than just 32-bit words,
you'll likely have many more degrees of freedom to generate many more
constants.

This demonstrates that *any invariant* in a crypto design---constant
numbers and coefficients, but also operations and their
combinations---can be manipulated. 
This is typically exploited if there exists a one-in-a-billion (or any
reasonably low-probability) weakness that's only known by the designer. 
Various degrees of exclusive exploitability ("NOBUS") may be achieved,
depending on what's the secret: just the attack technique, or some
secret value like in the malicious SHA-1.

The latest version of the PoC <https://github.com/veorq/numsgen> is
copied below. You may even use it to generate non-malicious constants.



```
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""
Generator of "nothing-up-my-sleeve" (NUMS) constants.

This aims to demonstrate that NUMS-looking constants shouldn't be
blindly trusted.

This program may be used to bruteforce the design of a malicious cipher,
to create somewhat rigid curves, etc. It generates close to 2 million
constants, and is easily tweaked to generate many more.

The code below is pretty much self-explanatory. Please report bugs.
